	Volume = {12},
	Year = {1970},
	Month = {August},
	Abstract = {THE recent growth of interest in quadraphony (i.e. sound reproduction via four loudspeakers) has encouraged the belief that four recording channels are necessary for a full quadraphonic effect. The author has recently published an account1 of a method of four-speaker reproduction of ordinary two-channel stereo that can give a convincing all-round-sound effect, despite certain theoretical and practical limitations. This poses the problem of whether one really needs to record or transmit four channels of audio for four speaker quadraphonic reproduction.},

	Title = {Ambisonics. Part two: Studio techniques},
	Journal = {Studio Sound},
	Volume = {17},
	Year = {1975},
	Month = {August},
	Abstract = {Conventional methods of `quadraphonic' reproduction may not convey the original sound field to best advantage. The studio techniques for ambisonics and its applications are discussed, in the light of both accepted `quadraphonic' techniques, and the requirements of further accurate reproduction of the sound field. Areas of compatibility and of disparity are discussed, to be read in the light of Peter Fellgett's system description.},
