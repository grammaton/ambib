	Abstract = {The recent growth of interest in quadraphony (i.e. sound reproduction via four loudspeakers) has encouraged the belief that four recording channels are necessary for a full quadraphonic effect. The author has recently published an account1 of a method of four-speaker reproduction of ordinary two-channel stereo that can give a convincing all-round-sound effect, despite certain theoretical and practical limitations. This poses the problem of whether one really needs to record or transmit four channels of audio for four speaker quadraphonic reproduction.},

	Volume = {12},
	Year = {1970},
	Month = {September},
	Abstract = {Current quadraphonic systems are designed to reproduce sound from all horizontal directions around the listener, but still fail to reproduce height information. In Part One of this article, by means of considering the types of sound pick-up associated with the use of a coincident microphone technique, it was shown that only three channels were necessary for ‘horizontal quadraphony’. In the following, these arguments will be extended to the reproduction of sound from all spatial directions about the listener, both horizontally and vertically. The author has christened reproduction techniques which reproduce all spatial directions ‘periphonic’ from the Greek prefix peri- meaning about, or around.},

	Abstract = {IN the September 1970 Studio Sound, the author proposed a new system of four-channel recording using the skew tetrahedral loudspeaker layout shown in fig. 1, which is essentially a conventional square four-speaker layout with the front left (LF) and rear right (RR) speakers raised to the ceiling, and the front right (RF) and rear left (LR) speakers lowered to the floor. By this means it was hoped to capture the original directional effect of all sounds around the listener, both horizontally and vertically.},

	Abstract = {Conventional methods of `quadraphonic' reproduction may not convey the original sound field to best advantage. The studio techniques for ambisonics and its applications are discussed, in the light of both accepted `quadraphonic' techniques, and the requirements of further accurate reproduction of the sound field. Areas of compatibility and of disparity are discussed, to be read in the light of Peter Fellgett's system description.},
