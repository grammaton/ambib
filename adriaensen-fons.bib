	Abstract = {This paper introduces a Linux audio application that provides an integrated solution for making full 3-D Ambisonics recordings by using a tetrahedral micro- phone. Apart from the basic A to B format conver- sion it performs a number of auxiliary functions such as LF filtering, metering and monitoring, turning it into a complete Ambisonics recording processor. It also allows for calibration of an individual micro- phone unit based on measured impulse responses. A new JACK backend required to make use of a partic- ular four-channel audio interface optimised for Am- bisonic recording is also introduced.},
